            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A search engine browses the web using automated programs called <b> web crawlers. </b> Web crawlers are automated bots that visit each page available on the Internet. The web crawlers send a copy of each page, including URLs, words, and images, back to the search engine, which then builds an <b> index </b> of the words on each page. This is a never-ending process since content is constantly changing and the web crawlers must re-crawl sites again and again to see if anything has changed. An Internet user such as yourself then creates a <b> query </b> by submitting even a single word on a search engine. The search engine uses <b> algorithms </b> to look for clues to better understand what the user is searching for. The algorithm pulls from relevant items in the index but also <b> ranks </b> the index based on factors like number of page visits, whether other webpages link to it, etc. to find the best results. </p>

            <p class="lead"> <ol> <li> <b class="lifont"> Guide your web crawler: </b> Web crawlers cannot "see" all of the content that is available the way human users do. Incorporating a simple file called <a href= "https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en"> Robots.txt </a> can help specify what pages on a website must or must not be crawled by search engine bots. Robots.txt files inform search engine spiders how to interact with indexing your content. For example, if you want to allow indexing of everything on your site, the robots.txt format would be: <br>
            <br>
            <div align="center"> Example: <mark class="highlight"> User-agent: *<br>
            Allow: /</mark> </li>
          </div>
            <br>
              <li> <b class="lifont">Meta/title tags:</b> Meta tags allow the owner of a page to specify key words and concepts under which the page will be indexed. Often times words on a page can have several possible meanings so meta tags can guide web crawlers in choosing the correct or intended meaning. One thing that content developers need to be careful of however is overusing or stuffing content with meta tags that have nothing to do with the actual contents of the page. This does not fool search engines into displaying your page just because that meta tag is used. Web crawlers will reject meta tags that don't match the words on the page so be careful not to be over-reliant on meta tags. Here are some tips to maximize your meta tags for SEO. Fill them out as completely as possible. To properly optimize your meta tags you should use as many characters as space allows. For many search engine users the meta tag could be their first encounter/interaction with your company or product. Aim for about 70 characters in the page title, 160 characters in the meta description, and no more than 10 keywords or phrases.

              <br>
              Kristine Schachinger explains in her article for <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/category/seo/"> Search Engine Watch </a>that title tags are part of the meta tags that appear at the top of your HTML inside the < head> area. Title tags are like the title of the chapter of a book. It tells people and search engines what your page is about.
              <br>
              Title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results. The title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about.
              <br>
              <br>
              There are many things to consider when attempting to optimize title tags:
              <ul> <li><u>Length-</u> Title tags should be a maximum of 70 characters long, including spaces.</li>
                <br>
              <li> <u>Keyword Placement-</u> The most important words (keywords) need to be first in your title tag, with the least important words listed last in the title tag. Search engines read left to right as most important to least important.</li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Keyword Separation-</u> Use pipes | to separate important (keyword) phrases. Do not include commas, underscores, dashes or any other punctuation unless the keyword is written that way. </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Wording-</u> Keep important phrases short and simple. Leave out words that would make it read like a sentence. (e.g., and, if, but, then, etc.)
              <br>
              <br>
              <li><u>Company Name-</u> If the company name is not part of the important phrases, put it at the end of the title tag; if it is part of the important words, put it as the first words in the title tag. Some SEOs will suggest leaving it out. It can be left in for branding purposes, however because people will see the brand and click. Keep in mind that this isnâ€™t valid for all sites.</ul>
              <br>
              <br> <div align="center"> Bad Example: <mark class="highlight"> Yellow Paint, Blue Paint, All Colors Of Paint | Paint Paint and More | Sherwin-Williams</mark>
              <br>
              Good Example: <mark class="highlight">Blue &amp; Yellow Paint | Paint Swatches | Sherwin-Williams </mark>
              </div>
              <br>
              <li> <b class="lifont"> Dynamic URL writing: </b> Part of maximizing they way bots crawl your site it to ensure that your site structure and filenames are all strategically created. There are a few things to consider.
                <ul> <li> <u>Avoid dates-</u> dates convey irrelevant or old news. If a date is included in your file structure your click-through rates may be lower because most search engines, especially Google, outs fresh cache dates in many search results. Dates also make it harder to share URLs. Including a date makes the file paths longer. This makes links more susceptible to breaking particularly if being sent over email. If a link is broken than visitors cannot access and view your content and continue to share it. </li>
              <br>
              <li> <u>Avoid capital letters-</u> URLs are case sensitive so avoid using capital letters that will confuse visitors. If human readers can't read your URLs than search engines certainly can't either.  </li>
              <br>
              <li> <u>Always use hyphens-</u> Search engine bots interpret punctuation differently when crawling and indexing a site. Google specifically reads underscores and hyphens differently when web crawling so be careful not to confuse these symbols. Hyphens allow Google to more accurately identify what the page is about. For example, if a URL includes <i> tips_for_instant_weight_loss </i> then a search engine would read it as <i> tipsforinstantweightloss </i> and won't be able to discern the words. However, if hyphens are used to link to keywords in a URL; <i> tips-for-instant-weight-loss </i> then search engines can return the words in a number of combinations for greater visibility. Users may also make the mistake of thinking underscores are spaces in a URL as underlining in the link hides the underscores. To avoid this confusion, use hyphens which are clearly visible and makes users more likely to correctly search for your websites URL.</li>
              <br>
              <li> <u>Add target keywords-</u> Web crawlers scan URLS to better connect their users to relevant content. However, Keyword density is no longer a concept. </li>
              </ul> </li>
              <br>
              <div align="center"> Bad Example: <mark class="highlight"> http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/602-9912342-3046240?

              <br>
              <li> <b class="lifont"> Optimize load speed: </b> A page's load speed is a factor in search-engine rankings and it also affects the rates of converting visitors to customers because page loading is an important factor for web users. According to Jason Demers, Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.audiencebloom.com/">AudienceBloom</a> a content marketing and social media marketing firm, 40% of website visitors abandon a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load.

              <ul>
              <li> <u> File compression-</u> Use software applications like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/"> Gzip </a> for file compression. This will reduce the size of your CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files that are larger than 150 bytes. <i>Note:</i> This will not work for images.</li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Optimize code-</u>By removing extra spaces and punctuation page speed will increase. Removing comments is another way to optimize code to improve performance. </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Optimize images-</u> Choosing the right file format can be for the web is critical. PNGs are typically better for graphics with minimal color whereas JPGs are best for photographs. Images can be compressed in Photoshop where the quality of the image will not be impacted by altering the size.</li>
              <br>
              <li><u> Website speed tests-</u> Using tools like <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/"> WebPageTest.org, </a> a website speed test can help analyze the load speed of a website. With this diagnostic, the test can examine all parts of a web page, view file sizes, load times, and other details about every single element of a web page (HTML, JavaScript and CSS files, images, etc.). It will also offer a general performance overview with performance grade tips to see how your website compares to best practices from Google Page Speed. A diagnostic such as this will also trace a site's performance history and test the speed from other countries. A slow page speed means that web crawlers search fewer pages, which could negatively impact the indexation of a site on a search engine such as Google.</li>
            </ul>
              <br>
              <li> <b class="lifont"> Earn links:</b> Google has something called <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en"> Webmaster Guidelines </a>that outline guidelines to follow when creating a webpage. In these guidelines are also explicit things to avoid that could lead to a site being removed entirely from Google's index. <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356"> Link schemes </a> is a way to manipulate links on a website such as buying or selling links that pass PageRank, the algorithm used by Google to rank websites in the search engine results. Other link schemes include partner pages that exist for the sake of cross-linking, using automated programs or services to create links to a site, links with excessive anchor text in articles or press releases distributed to other sites.

            <p class="lead">SEO is narrower and more technical, whereas <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/2014/09/19/what-is-content-marketing/#5c8a9b481d70"> content marketing </a> is a broader and more holistic approach to maximizing page content. Despite all of the tips that can help web developers make their site work as effectively as possible based on the search engine processes, it is important to remember that <b>publishing quality content is the number one driver of search engine rankings and there truly is no substitute for relevant and engaging content.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Content marketing is defined by The Content Marketing Institute as a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience â€“ and ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. I agree that the focus should be on optimizing page views through valuable content. If the content that you are writing is appropriately written for the intended user, then your target audience will find your content and improve your site's authority and relevance with page views and shares without relying on understanding <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/howsearchworks/algorithms.html"> Google's algorithm.</a> Content developers often times get wrapped up in including as many keywords as they can, but this is a very out of date practice and it is important to create natural, organic content. The perception of SEO requires a fresh update. Once this quality content is created, content must then be constantly updated as regularly updated content impacts the audience's perspective of relevancy. Fresh content gets rapidly indexed, and registers higher in the SERPs than older low-value content. Content matters for consumers therefore content must matter for            producers of content.
            <br>
            <p class="lead"> Paul Boag, suggests in his article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/">"The Inconvenient Truth About SEO"</a>, published in <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/"> Smashing Magazine</a> that the primary objective of every website should be better content, not higher page rankings. Web developers should be optimizing their pages for people rather than search engines. The best way to do so is to develop a website internally with employees who understand the business. Outsourcing to an SEO company may not provide for the best interaction among searchers. Boag also suggests that it not be solely the marketing department's role to create content. Companies would be better suited distributing the role of writing content to those who are most familiar with the content itself. </p>

           <p class="lead"> <b>What qualifies as good content? Uniqueness.</b> Original content will engage your readers and bring in the traffic you seek. Creating unique content has the most time and costs associated it however therefore it helps if you are knowledgeable and passionate about your topic or brand. Taking the time to conduct thorough research and then bringing something new to the table establishes originality as well as authority to set a site apart from the rest. </p>

            <p class="lead"> An important aspect of SEO is making your website easy for both users and search engine robots to understand. Understanding how search engines work will certainly help you engage in the technical aspect of optimizing web pages for page rank. These practices include compressing files, guiding web crawlers, crafting dynamic URLs and more. In doing so, however, it is important to not overlook the quality of content that is being produced. Creating unique content that is audience-focused will guarantee the greatest return on interaction with your site because the content will be natural and engaging.
